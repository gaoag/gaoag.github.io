<h2>My academic/work/life focus:</h2>
	    <p>I believe that many technologies of "sight" (particularly in machine learning and data science), paired with the broader sociotechnical imaginary of augmented understanding via data, have dulled our attentive faculties rather than augmented them. They have privileged particular ways of seeing and knowing. They  contribute to a false sense of understanding. Rather than acknowledging complexity, these technologies often serve to bulldoze it. </p>
	    <p>This <i>sucks</i>. </p>
	    <p>I want to help re-develop this attentive faculty in people. I want to re-develop and hone my own attentive faculty. I want our technologies to encourage intentional and deliberate lives rather than rule-driven, algorithmic ones. What if our information representations acknowledged and revealed complexity rather than abstracted them away? What if those representations made us "work" more to get something out of it? Would that encourage us to look more deeply and closely in our own lives? A picture is worth a thousand words - how can we move towards the picture worth a thousand pictures, the information representation that communicates more deeply and truly? Maybe that's the realm of art, not technology. I'm trying to figure that out. </p>
